Welcome to the Daily Schedule App!

For first time use: Run the program "GetInputSimple" to input all of your classes.
This will input them into a file, and you'll never have to input them again!

After you've already inputted your schedule: Run the program "ArrayMaker".

NOTE: in order to run the ArrayMaker program with the weather API, you'll need to format
your call in terminal in the following way:

    javac -classpath ".:gson-2.8.5.jar" ArrayMaker.java
    java -classpath ".:gson-2.8.5.jar" ArrayMaker

We know this is a little complicated, but this is our first COSI class, after all.
We're trying our best. We hope you enjoy the Code-Explode Daily Schedule App!
